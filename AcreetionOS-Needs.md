# CI/CD Needs
1. Build Process:
   - How often do you plan to build the distribution?
   - Will you need to build multiple variants (e.g., different desktop environments, server vs. desktop)?
   - What are the hardware requirements for the build process?

2. Testing:
   - What types of tests will you run? (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, system tests)
   - Will you need automated testing for package compatibility?
   - How will you test the bootable ISO?

3. Release Management:
   - How often do you plan to release new versions?
   - Will you maintain multiple release channels (e.g., stable, testing, unstable)?
   - How will you handle versioning?

4. Infrastructure:
   - What are the specifications of your build server?
   - Will you need additional servers for testing or staging?
   - How will you handle backups of build artifacts and source code?

5. GitLab Integration:
   - Which GitLab features do you plan to use for CI/CD? (e.g., GitLab Runners, GitLab Pages)
   - How will you manage access control and permissions in GitLab?

6. ISO Distribution:
   - How will you automate the process of uploading new ISOs to the project website?
   - Will you need to implement a system for tracking downloads or gathering user feedback?

7. Security:
   - How will you ensure the integrity of the build process?
   - What measures will you take to secure the build server and the distribution pipeline?

8. Documentation:
   - How will you maintain documentation for the build process and release procedures?
   - Will you need to generate changelogs automatically?

9. Monitoring and Logging:
   - What metrics do you want to track in your CI/CD pipeline?
   - How will you handle logging and error reporting?

10. Scalability:
    - How do you plan to handle increased build demands as the project grows?
    - Will you need to implement any caching mechanisms for faster builds?

11. Package Management:
    - How will you handle package updates and dependencies?
    - Will you maintain your own package repositories?

12. Community Contributions:
    - How will you integrate and test community contributions?
    - Will you need a system for managing pull requests and code reviews?

Additional considerations:

- Compliance: Ensure that your distribution complies with open-source licenses and Arch Linux guidelines.
- Localization: Consider how you'll handle building and testing for different languages and regions.
- Rollback and Recovery: Plan for how to handle failed builds or releases, including rollback procedures.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or discuss any specific area in more detail?
