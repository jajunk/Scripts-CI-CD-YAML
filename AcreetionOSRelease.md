# Release Management

*GitLab Version*

3. Release Management:

Effective release management is crucial for maintaining a stable and up-to-date distribution. Here are some suggested solutions:

a) Release Frequency:
- Implement a time-based release cycle (e.g., monthly for stable releases, weekly for testing).
- Set up automated nightly builds for the development branch.

b) Release Channels:
- Maintain three channels: stable, testing, and unstable (development).
- Use GitLab environments to manage different release stages.

c) Versioning:
- Implement semantic versioning (e.g., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Automate version bumping based on commit messages or manual triggers.

d) Release Notes and Changelogs:
- Automatically generate changelogs from commit messages.
- Use GitLab releases to document each version.

e) Release Approval Process:
- Implement a manual approval step for promoting releases between channels.

Here's a suggested GitLab CI/CD configuration for this section:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release

variables:
  STABLE_VERSION: 1.0.0

.release_template: &release_definition
  stage: release
  script:
    - ./generate_changelog.sh
    - ./bump_version.sh
    - ./create_release_notes.sh
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - changelog.md
      - release_notes.md

release_unstable:
  <<: *release_definition
  environment:
    name: unstable
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "develop"
      when: always

release_testing:
  <<: *release_definition
  environment:
    name: testing
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "testing"
      when: manual

release_stable:
  <<: *release_definition
  environment:
    name: stable
  variables:
    STABLE_VERSION: ${STABLE_VERSION}
  script:
    - *release_definition
    - ./update_download_page.sh
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
      when: manual
```

This configuration sets up release jobs for each channel (unstable, testing, stable). Key features include:

1. Use of a template (`.release_template`) to define common release steps.
2. Different triggering rules for each channel (automatic for unstable, manual for testing and stable).
3. Environment-specific configurations.
4. Additional steps for stable releases (e.g., updating the download page).

To implement this effectively:

1. Create scripts for version bumping, changelog generation, and release note creation.
2. Use GitLab environments to manage different release stages and their specific configurations.
3. Implement a clear branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow) to manage different release channels.
4. Set up automated notifications (e.g., email, Slack) for new releases.
5. Implement a rollback strategy for each release channel in case of critical issues.

Additional considerations:

- Archive old releases for users who may need to downgrade.
- Implement a system for tracking which packages are included in each release.
- Consider setting up a public roadmap for upcoming releases and features.
