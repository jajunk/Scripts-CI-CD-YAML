# Testing AcreetionISO
*GitLab Varient*
2. Testing:

For a custom Linux distribution, comprehensive testing is crucial to ensure stability and functionality. Here are some suggested solutions:

a) Types of Tests:
- Unit Tests: Implement unit tests for any custom packages or scripts.
- Integration Tests: Test the interaction between different components of the system.
- System Tests: Perform full system tests on the built ISO.

b) Automated Testing:
- Use tools like QEMU or VirtualBox for automated VM-based testing.
- Implement package compatibility tests using tools like `namcap` for Arch packages.

c) ISO Testing:
- Automate ISO boot testing using tools like `testiso` or custom scripts with QEMU.
- Test installation process in a virtual environment.

d) Functional Tests:
- Implement automated GUI testing for desktop variants using tools like Selenium or PyAutoGUI.
- Create scripts to test basic system functionality (networking, audio, etc.).

e) Performance Tests:
- Implement basic performance benchmarks to catch any significant regressions.

Here's a suggested GitLab CI/CD configuration for this section:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

variables:
  ISO_PATH: "output/latest.iso"

unit_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - ./run_unit_tests.sh

package_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pacman -Sy namcap --noconfirm
    - ./test_packages.sh

iso_boot_test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y qemu-system-x86
    - ./test_iso_boot.sh $ISO_PATH
  dependencies:
    - build_iso

installation_test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - ./test_installation.sh $ISO_PATH
  dependencies:
    - build_iso

gui_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pip install pyautogui
    - ./run_gui_tests.sh
  dependencies:
    - build_iso

performance_benchmark:
  stage: test
  script:
    - ./run_benchmarks.sh
  dependencies:
    - build_iso
  allow_failure: true  # Don't fail the pipeline for performance changes, but flag them
```

This configuration sets up various testing stages that run after the build stage. It includes unit tests, package tests, ISO boot tests, installation tests, GUI tests, and performance benchmarks.

Key points:
1. Use dependencies to ensure tests run on the latest built ISO.
2. Allow performance benchmarks to fail without failing the entire pipeline, as performance can vary.
3. Utilize appropriate tools (QEMU, namcap) for different types of tests.

To implement this effectively:
1. Create robust, modular test scripts that can run in the CI environment.
2. Use artifacts to pass the ISO between jobs.
3. Implement comprehensive logging in test scripts to ease debugging.
4. Consider setting up a matrix of tests for different hardware configurations or variants.
